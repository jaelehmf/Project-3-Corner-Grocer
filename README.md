# Project-3-Corner-Grocer

This project focused on creating a C++ program for managing grocery items, aiming to solve the challenge of efficiently organizing and analyzing inventory. It offered functionalities like searching for specific items, displaying their frequencies, generating item-based histograms, and creating backups. The program utilized object-oriented programming (OOP) principles through the GroceryItem class, allowing users to manage individual items in a structured manner.

Areas of strength included the structured code design, effective use of the vector data structure for managing collections of GroceryItem objects, and a user-friendly menu-driven interface. However, opportunities for improvement lay in refining error handling, implementing input validation for robustness against invalid user inputs, and enhancing code documentation for better readability.

The most challenging aspects involved implementing case-insensitive searches without relying on standard library functions and ensuring robust error handling. Overcoming these challenges involved manually converting strings to lowercase for comparison and devising strategies to handle diverse user inputs.

Skills gained, including OOP concepts, data structure handling, error management, and user interface design, will be highly transferable to future projects or coursework requiring similar problem-solving approaches. To ensure maintainability, readability, and adaptability, the code was organized with clear naming conventions, encapsulation of functionalities within the GroceryItem class, and separation of concerns for improved modularity.

In summary, the project addressed inventory management challenges through structured code design and user-friendly functionalities, with room for enhancements in error handling and input validation. The skills acquired, particularly in OOP, data handling, and user interface design, will be valuable for future programming endeavors. The program's readability and maintainability were ensured through structured coding practices, setting a foundation for adaptability and scalability in the future.
